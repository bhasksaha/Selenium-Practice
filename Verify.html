<p>A positive attitude leads to happiness and success and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your environment and the people around you.

If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. It's as if you radiate light around you.</p>
